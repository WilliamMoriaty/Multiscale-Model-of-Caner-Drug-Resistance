# Model-Cancer-Drug-Resistance
A Novel Dynamics-Based Multidimensional Data Integration Reveals the Impact of Epigenetic Instability on Acquired Drug Resistance in Cancer.
This fold includes the codes for multidimensinal data analysis and numerical simulation of mathematical modeling of acquired drug resistance in cancer reveals the impact of epigenetic instability.
1. The document "Multiscale Model" performs single-cell-based stochastic simulation. In this document, we  apply a stochastic simulation to model the progression of acquired drug resistance.
Usage:
In the folder, the command "compile.sh" is used to generate the execute file bct_PersisterCell
The input files md.in and par.dat are edited to change the control parameter and the parameter values
The command "run.sh" dominates running of the program.
2. The document "Single-Cell Model" performs PDE numerical simulation. In this document, we model the emergence probability of three cell types during the progression of acquired drug resistance.
3. The document "Single-Cell Analysis" performs model-based clustering and statistic analysis to single-cell RNA sequencing data.
4. The document "Multidimensional data" includes all real datasets from published literatures. More details are in the manuscript.
