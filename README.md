# Model-Cancer-Drug-Resistance
A Novel Dynamics-Based Multidimensional Data Integration Reveals the Impact of Epigenetic Instability on Acquired Drug Resistance in Cancer.
This fold includes the codes for multidimensinal data analysis and numerical simulation of mathematical modeling of acquired drug resistance in cancer reveals the impact of epigenetic instability.
1. The document "Multiscale Model" performs single-cell-based stochastic simulation. In this document, we  apply a stochastic simulation to model the progression of acquired drug resistance.

Usage:
In the folder, the command "compile.sh" is used to generate the execute file bct_VirusCell
The input files md.in and par.dat are edited to change the control parameter and the parameter values
The command "run.sh" dominates running of the program.
Note: Folders Sens_Model, Symptom,Code, Model and Therapy_model are similar with folder MultisViralinfection. 
Subtle differences are presented in the source codes System.cpp, BCTool.cpp and CCell.cpp.
2. The document "DataAnalysis" includes all code of presenting the figures in result section and Supplimentary documentary.  
Some running codes need data from the C++ codes running. The operating procedures refers to the file "readme.txt".
3. The document "Datasets" includes all real datasets from published literatures. Many details are in the main text.
